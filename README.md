# DataMining
Data analysis using two sets of different real-life data was
performed. Two predictive data mining techniques were used,
namely clustering and classification. To achieve reliable and
accurate results, pre-processing techniques such as scaling,
feature selection and feature extraction had to be performed on
both datasets prior to classification and clustering. To gain a more
thorough understanding of each technique, two clustering
algorithms called K-Means and BIRCH were applied on the
climate dataset and two classification algorithms called SVM and
RF were applied on the video dataset.
