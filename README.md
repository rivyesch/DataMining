# DataMining
Data analysis using two sets of different real-life data was performed. Two predictive data mining techniques were used, namely clustering and classification. To achieve reliable and accurate results, pre-processing techniques such as scaling, feature selection and feature extraction had to be performed on both datasets prior to classification and clustering. The two clustering algorithms used on the climate dataset are K-Means and BIRCH whilst the two classification algorithms applied on the video dataset are SVM and Random Forest (RF).
